# Abstract

This study focuses on the development of a strategic framework for the design of a hydrogen supply chain network (HSCN) mainly investigating the potential of industrial decarbonization and multi-sectors integration (i.e., transportation, energy, shipping) via green hydrogen economy. The problem was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and solved in GAMS/ IBM ILOG CPLEX 30.3.0 solver. The applicability of the developed model was demonstrated using a base case Eco-industrial city consisting of 10 diverse industrial portfolios targeting decarbonization by 5%. The solution was able to find the optimal HSCN from the probable superstructure along with the optimal sizing of green hydrogen production (453.03 MM kg/y), optimal water sources, optimal sinks and the optimal amount of byproducts generation. Furthermore, the multi-purpose model can accomplish detailed techno-economic-environmental analysis for variable scenarios (e.g., variation in decarbonization target, liquid hydrogen demand, hydrogen production cost, earnings from byproducts) based on net present value.
